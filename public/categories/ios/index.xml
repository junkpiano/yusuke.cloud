It&amp;rsquo;s available in iOS 12 or later.
import Network You must retain NWPathMonitor instances to get callbacks.
class NetworkMonitorViewController: ViewController { let monitor = NWPathMonitor() } requiredInterface lets you observe the specific network interface.
let wifiMonitor = NWPathMonitor(requiredInterfaceType: .wifi) Here is the list of interfaces that NWPathMonitor supports.

Kiri is Moya inspired abstract networking layer. I was very impressed by Moya architecture, so to learn from it the most, I decided to trace the same architecture by writing by myself, instead of copy and paste. :D
We need to break down client library into three parts.
Request Normally, you have to construct networking request every time.</description></item></channel></rss>
